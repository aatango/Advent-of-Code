## 2023

Haskell

Pipe the input to the compiled target, for example: `cat 1.input | ./1`.

## 2022
C++

To use the included deployment script (aoc.sh), please download the desired examples and inputs to {DAY}.ex, and {DAY}.input respectively (e.g.: 1.cpp; 1.ex; and 1.input).
You can now simply call the script, and pass the day and file as arguments. The source will be compiled, and automatically run.

## 2021
Aimed to do these on time, using Python. Totalled 16/50 on time. Will be doing the rest without time constraint.

## 2020
Started here; did a few in Python, as warmup for 2021's event. Might do these in the future, with a different language.
